Zones as SMF services, as detailed in my article on OI Wiki
http://wiki.openindiana.org/oi/Zones+as+SMF+services

Currently this includes all the code defined as part of the SMF manifests,
so nothing to install except registration of the two XMLs. See Wiki article
for more details.

Hope this helps,
